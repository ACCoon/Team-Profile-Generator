# Team-Profile-Generator
## Description
This project aims to create a command-line application that accepts information from the user to generate an HTML page displaying the members of a project team.

A sample HTML file generated by the application is included in the output directory in this repo.

## Functionality
The application sets the first record input as the team manager, while the other records are determined by the user as either Engineers or Interns. The user can also indicate when they are done adding employee records, prompting the application to then generate the HTML file.

This project utilizes the Inquirer package for retrieving data from the user, and the Jest package for development testing.

## Credit
A significant portion of the template HTML generated by the application as well as the code to generate it was provided by Trilogy Education Services, LLC, a 2U, Inc. brand.
